 * reparses that output into one React <Text> per style span, lays out each
 * span as a Yoga flex child, then walks the tree to re-emit the same escape
 * codes it was given. For a long transcript full of syntax-highlighted diffs
 * that roundtrip is the dominant cost of the render.
 *
 * This component emits a single Yoga leaf with a constant-time measure func
 * (width × lines.length) and hands the joined string straight to output.write(),
 * which already splits on '\n' and parses ANSI into the screen buffer.
